Problem statement:
It's dinner time! Create an application that helps users find the most relevant recipes that they can prepare with the ingredients that they have at home

Solution:
The focus is on the core functionality, and providing a minimal solution that works with the possibility of future extentions. So here are the user stories:
1. As a user, I want to input my available ingredients, so I can find matching recipes.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
      - User submits a list of ingredients.
      - The system returns recipes that contain some or all of the provided ingredients.
      - The results are sorted by relevance (recipes requiring fewer missing ingredients are ranked higher).
      - The matching ingredients are highlighted.
2. As a user, I want to view detailed information about a recipe, so I can see its ingredients, preparation time, cooking time, etc.
   - Acceptance Criteria:
      - Clicking on a recipe shows its name, ingredients, etc.
